                Trump to Announce Carrier Plant Will Keep Jobs in U.S. NOV. 29, 2016

                Trump’s Promises Will Be Hard to Keep, but Coal Country Has Faith NOV. 28, 2016

                Opinion Contributing Opinion Writer
                Mexico Awaits Trump’s Next Move NOV. 15, 2016
                Indeed, Rexnord, the ball bearing factory in Indianapolis where Mr. Jones went to work straight out of
                high school nearly 40 years ago, said in October it would be moving to Mexico. It is just a mile from
                the Carrier plant.

                The mayor of Indianapolis, Joe Hogsett, and Senator Joe Donnelly, both Democrats, tried to exert
                Trumplike pressure to force Rexnord to rethink its plans, but so far the company has not shown any sign
                it will change course.

                “On a personal level at Carrier, it is huge,” said Jerry N. Conover, director of the Indiana Business
                Research Center at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. “But by itself, the
                disappearance or retention of 1,000 jobs is a small slice of the total economy in Indiana.”

                “I think there will be continued downward pressure on employment in factories because of trends toward
                automation especially and moving to lower-cost areas for production,” he added.

                Carrier, in its official statement on the deal on Wednesday, said that it thought the agreement it
                negotiated with Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence “benefits our workers, the state of
                Indiana and our company.” But it said that incentives provided by Indiana, where Mr. Pence is governor,
                “were an important consideration.” It added that “the forces of globalization will continue to require
                solutions for the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. and American workers.”

                Those 1,000 Carrier jobs saved represent just 0.2 percent of total manufacturing employment in the
                state. And despite a rebound since the aftermath of the Great Recession, at just over half a million
                positions, factory employment in Indiana this year is still down by more than 20 percent since 2000.

                The good news is that Indiana has been doing well economically, with an unemployment rate below the
                national average and steady gains in employment like food service, retail and logistics.

                But those service jobs pay well below the $20 to $25 an hour that veteran Carrier employees — with only
                a high school diploma — can earn building furnaces and fan coils in Indianapolis. The typical
                manufacturing worker in the state earns $59,000 a year, about $20,000 a year more than the typical
                service job.</p>
